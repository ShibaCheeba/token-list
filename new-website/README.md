## Customization Guide 🎨

The website uses a blue color scheme. To change colors, edit these CSS variables in `styles.css`:

```css
/* Main brand color */
#2563eb → Your primary color
#1d4ed8 → Your primary color (darker shade)

/* Text colors */
#1f2937 → Your dark text color
#6b7280 → Your light text color
```

### Updating Content

#### 1. Company Name/Brand
- Change "YourBrand" in `index.html` (appears in navigation and footer)
- Update the title in the `<title>` tag

#### 2. Hero Section
- Edit the main headline and subtitle
- Update button links and text

#### 3. About Section
- Replace the story text with your own
- Update the statistics (projects, clients, experience)

#### 4. Services Section
- Replace service titles and descriptions
- Change icons using Font Awesome classes
- Add or remove service cards as needed

#### 5. Portfolio Section

#### 6. Contact Information

### Adding Real Images

To replace the placeholder graphics with real images:

1. Add your images to an `images/` folder
2. Replace the placeholder divs with `<img>` tags:

```html
<!-- Replace this: -->
<div class="portfolio-placeholder">
    <i class="fas fa-image"></i>
</div>

<!-- With this: -->
<img src="images/your-image.jpg" alt="Project Description">
```

### Customizing Fonts

The website uses Inter font from Google Fonts. To change fonts:

1. Update the Google Fonts link in `index.html`
2. Change the font-family in `styles.css`

### Contact Form Setup

The contact form currently shows a success message. To make it functional:

1. **Client-side only**: Keep current setup (shows success message)
2. **Server integration**: Add backend processing in `script.js`
3. **Third-party service**: Integrate with services like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or EmailJS

#### Example with EmailJS:

```javascript
// Add this to script.js after including EmailJS library
emailjs.send('service_id', 'template_id', formData)
    .then(() => {
        showNotification('Message sent successfully!', 'success');
    })
    .catch(() => {
        showNotification('Failed to send message. Please try again.', 'error');
    });
```
